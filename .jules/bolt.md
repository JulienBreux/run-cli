## 2026-03-06 - GCP Revisions Client Caching
**Learning:** Failing to cache the GCP Revisions client meant that navigating and reloading service revisions in the TUI invoked credential discovery and gRPC setup on every revision fetch. Standardizing the stateful `sync.Mutex` lazy-initialization pattern ensures that once a client is cached, subsequent service revision lists are lightning fast.
**Action:** Consistently inspect all subcommand and subpackage API wrappers to ensure that client connections are pooled and not destroyed on request boundaries.

## 2026-03-05 - GCP Services Client Caching
**Learning:** Initializing Google Cloud Platform API clients and discovering credentials (ADC) on every single request in a terminal user interface (TUI) introduces a major latency bottleneck (~300ms per request) due to repetitive file system lookups and TCP/gRPC handshakes. Caching the client wrapper using a thread-safe pattern (`sync.Mutex`) avoids this completely. Importantly, client construction must use `context.Background()` rather than request-scoped contexts to prevent cancellation of the shared client connection pool when a single request context is canceled.
**Action:** Always verify if external API or cloud clients are lazily initialized and cached as singletons/long-lived clients across successive TUI interactions, rather than being created and closed on every API call.

## 2025-05-15 - [GCP Client Creation Overhead]
**Learning:** Creating a new GCP client for every API call (especially in a TUI that frequently refreshes and can list all regions) introduces significant latency due to repeated credential discovery, TLS handshakes, and gRPC connection establishment. When listing "All" regions, this results in 24 simultaneous client creations and connection setups.
**Action:** Reuse a single, thread-safe GCP client per package (service, job, etc.) to leverage connection pooling and reduce overhead.
